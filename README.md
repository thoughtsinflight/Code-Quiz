# Code Quiz Project
    The purpose of this project is to create a site that uses javascript to move through a series of questions, track time, score and correct answer and store them for later use.
# Motivation
    I really wanted to perfrom well on this project, mainly because I believe javascript is very important to understand and utilize for many different projects.
# What I Learned
    Going in to this project I knew it would be difficult. I had a hard time with the activities in class and wasn't sure if I had the understanding to complete this task. I had to ask a lot of questions and I feel better for it. 
    I learned a lot about forEach loops and use them more and more. Functions are quite the work hourse for javascript, they seem like the main way to divide your code and delineate work in a ordered fashion. 
# Conclusion
    Last project I was confident going in and worked alone most of the time. It didn't very far. This time, I bother the TAs and spelt time after class making sure I understood everything and could fix my code.
